## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### i'm Pedro, full-stack web developer with 5 years of diverse experience spanning both web development and enterprise service solutions. I began my career as a Junior Web Developer at Freenet Digital before transitioning into ServiceNow roles at ProV Brasil, DXC Technology, and Proturity GmbHâ€”where I contributed to major projects for clients like Gerdau. Recently, I completed an intensive 3-month Next.js bootcamp to refresh and enhance my full-stack web development skills. I am now eager to leverage my broad technical background and agile problem-solving in a dedicated web development role.
